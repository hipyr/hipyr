Hello There!! 👋

My Name is Cameron, I am a Developer Based in the United States.
I've been coding for almost almost 6 years now bouncing all around all different types of coding languages but my main languages are typescript, javascript, and C++.
The project I have been mostly working on right now is my work scheduling app Shiftsline that I am currently making for a company but plan to make sell it to other companies as well!
I usually keep all of my repositories private until I fully finish working on them but if you would like to learn more about a project or talk to me about something feel free to email me!
